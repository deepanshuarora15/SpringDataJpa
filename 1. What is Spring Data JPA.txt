1. JDBC is the API provided by Java to connect to databases.
2. Problem: Java works on the concept of classes and objects. But database works in terms of tables?
3. Mapping these two is an issue in itself. Earlier we used to do inter-conversion.
4. Solution : Hibernate, IBatis and some other frameworks. But the problem here is that if you ever feel like shifting from one
   framework to another, a lot of code change is required which might break our - otherwise stable application.
5. Another better solution : Java now provides Java Persistence API or JPA Api, which is followed by the above mentioned ORM providers.
6. Remember that JPA is just a specification. Hence you as a software engineer still need to use the underlying ORM such as Hibernate.
   The relief is that with the introduction of JPA, the shifting from one framework to another has become relatively simpler.
